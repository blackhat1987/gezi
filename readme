gezi is a common util lib like folly, it is a base lib 
gezi use many third party code 
like boost in third-64/boost 
it will hold many third party code inside gezi path 

./third will contains some code like folly,rabit,cppformat, 
those code is unmodifed 

./include will contains some code like json(jsoncpp), cereal(for seralization like boost.seralization but quick and with json support), 
those code is modifed by myself

you can use 'folly/..h'
or 'cereal/..h'
For application code not advise to use third party header file in include path like 'cereal/..' directly :) 
For third party header file in ./third, use it in application code like 'folly/..' is fine 

some small third-party header file will be in  ./include/third/ 
if use them will use 'third/...'
these files mainly for experiment, like benchmark comparsion
if they work best, will move to other place in ./include :)
